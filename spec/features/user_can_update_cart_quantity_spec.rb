# Background: My cart has an item in it
# As a visitor
# When I visit "/cart"
# Then I should see my item with a quantity of 1
# And when I increase the quantity
# Then my current page should be '/cart'
# And that item's quantity should reflect the increase
# And the subtotal for that item should increase
# And the total for the cart should match that increase
# And when I decrease the quantity
# Then my current page should be '/cart'
# And that item's quantity should reflect the decrease
# And the subtotal for that item should decrease
# And the total for the cart should match that decrease
