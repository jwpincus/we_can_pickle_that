# As an authenticated Admin, when I visit an individual order page
# Then I can see the order's date and time.
# And I can see the purchaser's full name and address.
# And I can see, for each item on the order:
# - The item's name, which is linked to the item page.
# - Quantity in this order.
# - Price
# - Line item subtotal.
# And I can see the total for the order.
# And I can see the status for the order.
